            <h3 class="text-center">Animals Are Talking - Are You Listening?</h3>
          </h2>
          <p>Animals believe it or not, are just like us. They hurt, get confused and can become unhappy. They also need love and attention and importantly, to be included as part of their human family and treated with the upmost respect. Once you understand the intelligence and multi-level facets of the animal world, your life and theirs will change forever - I know this because it happened to me.

            Animals communicate in a silent language, and humans communicate in a verbal language. When we meet someone who does not speak our language, we don't assume that they have nothing to say, we just can't understand them. If we wish to communicate with them we either have to learn their language or use an interpreter. This silent language is both telepathic and intuitive. Animals are already masters of telepathic communication and talk to each other in this way, and any species including humans.
            
            Telepathy which means sending and receiving messages through a mind to mind connection. Intuitive or inner sensing involves the direct transmission of feelings, emotions, intentions, thoughts, mental images, impressions, sensations, and pure knowing. In this kind of communication you do not read body language or make guesses based on physical behaviour.
            
            I have been in love with animals since my life began. I could see through their eyes and communicate with them as if one of them. When I was two years old my mother was looking for me and found me lying in the dirt on my side looking into the eyes of our dog ‘Boy’ in silent connection. At 4 years of age I was often discovered down on all fours eating grass with our pet lamb. Up until the age of 7 years instead of watching TV like other kids I was in the backyard galloping and neighing like a horse. I felt, even at that young age, I wanted to experience the entire essence of what it is like to be a horse. Horses reminded me of the strength and freedom that is waiting to be unleashed in us all.
            
            My childhood was not always easy and sometimes trusting humans was a problem. Animals soon became my best friends and confidants. I would tell them not only my secrets but my hopes and dreams. Their amazing unconditional love and ability to not judge you or the situation made my life richer and more fulfilled. Animals seemed to understand me in a way that humans couldn’t. You can rely on animals as they will never let you down and they don’t know how to be cruel. In my opinion we have a lot to learn from them in so many ways.
            
            This silent language happens in several ways. I can hear the words that animals speak in my mind, and I also get a lot of visuals, either in pictures or like a video. These messages come telepathically. I can also feel their emotions and physical issues within my own body. My intuition is able to pick up all these images and impressions to give added information about any animal as a type of ‘pure knowing’. The wonderful news is that everyone is born with this ability, so we are all capable of communicating with animals in this way. Imagine having a two-way conversation with your dog or cat, it is quite extraordinary.
